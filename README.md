- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my github page! Iâ€™m @vitorestv and i am an Architect, Designer, and a recently graduated Front-End Developer. 
While working in the architecture field for the last 4 years, i have draft, designed and built some buildings and infrastructure. Now i feel its time to build something bigger, something that can really make a difference, and that's what drove me to the coding world.

- In the last months, i've been focusing my studies in UI/UX Design and ReactJS and deployed some apps that you can check at my website @ https://vitorest.github.io

- Feel free to also check my (still) little Adobe Portfolio @ https://vitorccastroo.myportfolio.com/
