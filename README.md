ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my github page! My name is Vitor Castro!

I'm a formed architecture technician who shifted into the coding world.

I started this journey by attending a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp, and for the last year I've been focusing my studies in Front-End Development.

You can have a look at some stuff i've been developing: https://vitorest.github.io
