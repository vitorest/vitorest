ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my github page! My name is Vitor and i am an Architect and Front-End Developer. 
While working in the architecture field for the last years, I have draft, designed and helped to build some buildings and infrastructures. Now I feel its time to build something bigger, something that can really make a difference, and that's what drove me to the coding world.

In the last year, i've been focusing my studies in UI/UX Design and ReactJS, those apps were deployed and you can check them at my website @ https://vitorest.github.io
